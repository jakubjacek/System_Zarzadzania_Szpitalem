The Hospital Management System is a web-based Java project with the main goal of creating a universal and user-friendly program for medical facilities. The system consists of four modules: Administrator, Doctor, Pharmacist, and Receptionist, each with a distinct role. The registration and login system ensures that only authenticated users can access certain functions.

1.The Administrator module is the heart of the system, with the ability to register other users and access the navigation panel to view important information.

2. The Doctor module is focused on patient treatment, with the ability to search for appointments, conduct patient meetings, prescribe medications, and issue treatment      pricing.

3. The Pharmacist module is responsible for managing the medicine database, with the ability to add, delete, and edit medicines, distributors, and companies.

4. The Receptionist module serves as the primary point of contact for patients, with the ability to register patients, schedule appointments with specific doctors, and      generate bills in PDF format after treatment.

The technologies used to create the program include Spring MVC, Spring Boot, JSP, Bootstrap, Tomcat Server, and Maven.
